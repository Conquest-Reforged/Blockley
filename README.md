## Get It
[![Latest](http://github-release-version.herokuapp.com/github/dags-/Blockley/release.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dags-/Blockley/releases/latest)

## Controls
- Press `'B'` while in-game to open the block list.
- Press `'CTRL' + 'B'` to re-generate the block list.

The `'B'` button is re-bindable within the Controls menu.

## Notes
Generating the blocklist may take a little while and may freeze the game temporarily. The list only needs to be generated when you first open it, or when you manually choose to re-generate it (after adding new blocks for example).

The block list is actually just a simple static web-page that can be accessed without the need for Minecraft to be open.

The page can be opened from `minecraft/config/blockley/index.html` using a web-browser.  

Note that the icon images are stored under `minecraft/config/blockley/images/..` and must be moved along-side the `index.html` file if you want to relocate it (it's simpler to just leave it where it is and create a shortcut instead).
